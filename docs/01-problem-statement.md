## Description

### Background

India's vast Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and coastline demand continuous,
high-resolution monitoring of ocean state variables. INCOIS routinely generates and
archives large volumes of ocean model outputs - including three-dimensional fields of
temperature, salinity, current vectors, chlorophyll, etc. - as well as real-time and
delayed-mode observations from autonomous instruments such as Argo profiling floats and
underwater Gliders. These datasets are stored in NetCDF and ASCII/text formats and span
multiple depth levels, spatial grids, and time steps.

Despite the richness of this data, no integrated, web-based 3D visualization platform
currently exists that can simultaneously render model fields and in-situ instrument
observations in a single interactive environment. Existing tools are either
desktop-bound, support only 2D plan views, or lack the ability to co-visualize model
outputs alongside instrument profiles. Operational oceanographers and forecasters are
therefore forced to toggle between disparate software packages, making it difficult to
rapidly correlate model predictions with observational evidence.

Key gaps identified include:

- No web-based, platform-independent 3D rendering of ocean model data (temperature,
  salinity, currents, etc.) with depth-resolved volumetric views.
- No unified display of Argo float and Glider profile data (latitude, longitude, depth,
  time, temperature, salinity, chlorophyll) alongside model fields.
- Absence of interactive controls for variable selection, depth-slice navigation,
  time-step animation, and customizable colorbars.
- Inability to ingest new observational data streams or additional model variables
  without significant re-engineering.
- Lack of tools to support intuitive, rapid understanding of complex 3D ocean phenomena
  for operational decision-making.

The absence of such a system impedes timely hazard assessment, search-and-rescue support,
fishery advisories, climate monitoring, etc. - all operational mandates of INCOIS.

### Expected Solution

The proposed solution is a web-based, browser-native 3D Ocean Data Visualization System
that integrates ocean model outputs with observational data on a single interactive
platform.

Core functional requirements:

- **3D Volumetric Rendering:** Interactive visualization of ocean model fields
  (temperature, salinity, current vectors) across the full water column, with support for
  depth-slice views, isosurface extraction, and time-step animation using WebGL /
  Three.js or Cesium.js.
- **Instrument Data Overlay:** Co-display of Argo float, Glider profile, CTD and BGC data
  using geospatially accurate markers; users can click a float/glider to inspect a
  depth-vs-variable profile chart with timestamps.
- **Multi-format Data Ingestion:** Automated parsers for NetCDF (via PyNIO / xarray
  backend) and delimited text formats, with a modular architecture that allows new
  variables or data sources to be added with minimal code change.
- **Customizable Colorbar & Variable Controls:** Dynamic colorbar editor (color palette,
  min/max range, log/linear scale), variable selector, layer opacity controls, and
  vertical exaggeration slider for intuitive depth perception.
- **Web-based, Scalable Architecture:** Frontend built on modern JavaScript frameworks
  with a lightweight REST/OPeNDAP API backend, enabling deployment on INCOIS
  infrastructure without any client-side dependencies.
- **Extensible Design:** Plugin-style module for future integration of additional sensors
  (e.g., CTDs, moorings, HF-radar, Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), etc.), new
  ocean model variables, and machine-learning derived products.

The system will follow open standards (OGC WMS/WCS, CF Conventions for NetCDF), enabling
interoperability with national and international ocean data portals.

The end product will empower INCOIS forecasters to perform rapid, intuitive analysis of
complex 3D ocean phenomena - significantly improving the speed and accuracy of
operational advisories, in the same way that 3D meteorological visualization has
transformed weather forecasting workflows.

### Public Outreach & Science Communication

Beyond operational use, the platform will serve as a powerful science communication tool.
Complex numerical ocean model outputs - which are typically inaccessible to
non-specialists - can be transformed into visually intuitive, interactive 3D experiences.

This makes the tool valuable for educating school and college students about ocean
dynamics, engaging the general public during awareness campaigns, and supporting
policymakers in understanding marine environmental conditions.

INCOIS can use the platform for outreach events, exhibitions, and e-learning initiatives,
bridging the gap between cutting-edge ocean science and the common person.

## Notes on the text — ours, not theirs

Kept separate from the verbatim text above so the two are never confused.

- **Both FTP links are dead from a normal network.** Port 21 is blocked and
  `ftp.ifremer.fr` does not connect. See `05-data-sources.md`.
- **Item (d) is truncated in the official listing** — "Collection of In-situ Data:" has no
  URL after it. Re-check the portal before submission in case it is patched.
- The brief names "PyNIO" for NetCDF parsing. PyNIO is archived and unmaintained; xarray,
  which the same sentence also names, is the live path and is what we use.
- "Plugin-style module" is satisfied by a dict of parsers, not a plugin framework — see
  `03-limitations.md` L11 for why that is a judgement call rather than a shortcut.
